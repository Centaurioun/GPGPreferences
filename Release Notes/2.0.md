GPGPreferences 2.0
==================

New
----
### Settings Redesigned
* Our long neglected child has received some major love. The settings have been completey redesigned. We hope you like the new layout.

### Send Report
* We hope you don't, but should you ever run into trouble and want to get in touch, it has never been easier. The new 'Send Report' tab provides an easy option to create a discussion on our known support platform.
* For debugging porpuses you can attach a debug log. It will be sent via encrypted TLS connection to our hoster. There it is encrypted with out team key and then sent to our support platform.
* This should help both you and us to be more effective in debugging problems you may be seeing.

Improvements
----
* We now pre-select a key for you as default key, should none be selected already. In case you have more than one key, that will be the latest key. There's really no reason not to be using the default key option. [#68]
