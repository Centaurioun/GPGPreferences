GPGPreferences 1.5b1 - Release Notes
==============================

Features
--------
*	 Add "Check Now" buttons for all the tools: it's never been easier to stay up-to-date with all components of GPG Suite, we now offer stable, pre-release and nightly channel for all tools. [#58]
*   copy all version info to the clipboard when clicking on that info in Updates tab: this makes it easier than ever to just copy paste the entire info to support requests. [#53]

Bugfixes
--------

*   Fully respect to not display version info: previously e.g. when exporting a key "MacGPG v2" was still added. This is no longer the case now. [#66]
*   Fixed a crash on 10.6 caused by the "Check Now" update button. [#54]
*   Fixed GPGPreferences not working for 32-bit users on 10.6. [#55]
*   GPGPreferences didn't want to remember when a user selected the nightly channel, it now does. [#59]

UI
--------
*   Display "Select a key..." instead of an empty combo box if no value is selected for default key. [#70]
*   Text of component names in Updates tab was cut off on OS X 10.10. [#65]
*    visually distinguish installed and not installed tools in update listing. [#52]
