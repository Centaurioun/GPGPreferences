GPGPreferences 1.0.1 - Release Notes
==============================

Features
--------

### Added Sparkle updates.

*   You'll be seeing an alert from within Mail.app if a new version of GPGMail
    is available.
*   You can choose between different types of releases:
    - nightly: each development build will appear as an update
    - pre-release: alpha and beta builds will appear as an update
    - stable: only stable builds will appear as an update
    (requires upcoming GPGPreferences)

### Option to "Use Keychain to store passphrases by default"

* Activate this option in GPGPreferences > Settings, if you want to store all your passphrases in the mac keychain by default.
* If you want to remove all that info, the Button "Delete stored passphrases" will get that done easily.

### Auto-retrieve key setting

* GPGMail will look for the public key needed to verify signatures of incoming mails and download that key if it is available on the key servers.

### New updates tab

* Major cleanup of the used tabs. The new Update tab now shows the version of all the tools installed and allows the user to select which update channel they want to be on for which tool.

Bugfixes
--------

*   No longer hangs when opened without having a gpg-agent.conf file.
*   Now uses correct spotlight metadata and displays as GPGPreferences.
