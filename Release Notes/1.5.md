GPGPreferences 1.5 Final - Release Notes
==============================

Features
--------

### Update management for all tools

* Add "Check Now" buttons for all the tools: it's never been easier to stay up-to-date with all components of GPG Suite. We now offer stable, pre-release and nightly channels for every single component of GPG Suite. [#58]

### Key server sanity check

* GPGPreferences now checks if a key server is valid and working, when a new one is entered. [#71]

### Copy version info into the clipboard
* By clicking on any version info in the Updates tab, all version info is copied into the clipboard. This makes it easier than ever to provide the complete version information along with your support requests. [#53]

Bugfixes
--------

* Respect the "display no version info" setting. When exporting a key, "MacGPG v2" was still added. This is no longer the case. [#66]
* Crash on 10.6 caused by "Check Now" button. [#54]
* Nightly channel didn't stick. The channel setting was not stored. [#59]
* Crash due to invalid value on "remember the passphrase for" setting. [#69]
* OS X 10.6: "delete stored passphrases" option didn't work properly. [#72]
* Display "Select a key..." instead of an empty combo box when no default key is selected. [#70]
* OS X 10.10: Text of component names in Updates tab cut off. [#65]
* Visually distinguish installed and not installed tools in update listing. [#52]
